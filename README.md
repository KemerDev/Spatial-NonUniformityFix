# Fixing Spatial-NonUniformity of different given planes

Different lighting conditions can lead to non-uniformities in an image plane,
one of them is Spatial non-uniformity that yields bright and dark regions in the target plane.

We can instantly tell the problem that occurs which can ultimately lead to machine detection problems, of little fine details,
especially when our light setup, hits our target plane not only from above but from an angle causing shadows.
